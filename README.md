## About The Exoplanetarium 3D

Goal: Develop a front-end web application based on a current design that allows a user to see a “map” of the sky above, or a “SpaceMap”.

- This SpaceMap responds to a mouse on desktop or touch on a smartphone or tablet.
- User can drill down into a spot on the map (like zooming in on google maps) and can investigate parts of the sky
- User is shown stars that are in the area of interest and a number of planets that orbit said star if any exist
- User can drill down to each planet and see some basic facts about the planet, including which research project discovered it
- This SpaceMap should be a 3D rendering of stars and planets and should give the user the chance to see multiple views of the planet
